# From here onwards we will learn about object oriented programming
# It is a type of programming in which we create and work with objects

# Objects is a way of specifying things in python
# It is defined by creating classes

# For example take two people X and Y and suppose that both are singers but suppose X is
# a Indian singer and Y is a german singer so  we will use class to specify them
# CLASSES=TEMPLATE
# OBJECT=INSTANCE OF A CLASS
# Actually object oriented programming works on the concept of DRY which means
# "do not repeat yourself"
# NOW WE HAVE LEARNT ABOUT BASIC CONCEPTS OF CLASS AND WE WILL CODE USING  THEM IN
# NEXT TUTORIALS
