# Polymorphism means to exist in different states.
# The concept of polymorphism has very strong ties with method overriding concept that
# we will learn in the next Tutorial i.e tutorial 65 of this course along with super() function.

# example -- gangadhar and shaktiman
#             joy and hero
#               power rangers
# they were only to explain the concept don't take it seriously
print(5+6)#this will give 11
print('5'+'6')#this will give 56
# here we added 5 nd 6 in two different ways to get 56 and 11 so here 5+6 was in two forms
# this is example of polymorphism
