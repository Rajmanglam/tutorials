'''The task is to create an “Online Library Management System”.
For this, you have to create a library class which includes the following methods:

Displaybook() : To display the available books
Lendbook(): To lend a book to a user
Addbook(): To add a book in the library
Returnbook(): To return the book in the library.'''

# As you have created a library class, now you will create an object and pass
# the following parameters in the constructor.
#
# HarryLibrary=Library(listofbooks, library_name)


# Create a library class
# display book
# lend book - (who owns the book if not present)
# add book
# return book

# HarryLibrary = Library(listofbooks, library_name)


#dictionary (books-nameofperson)

# create a main function and run an infinite while loop asking
# users for their input
