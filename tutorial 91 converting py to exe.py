# Today we will discuss the process of converting a python i.e., the
# .py file into an executable or .exe file. Let us start with the
# introduction of the .exe file. In windows, .exe is an extension
# used for executable files. It is one of the most common file
# extensions used for almost all kinds of software and applications
# programs and also setups.
#
# Now letâ€™s come to the purpose of the conversion. We create lots of
# Python programs and want to share it with the world. If we're going
# to convert our python program into an application that can be
# run in any computer without the IDE or even installing Python
# itself, we must convert it to .exe. All the apps and programs we
# use in our computer are written using some language or code, but
# we do not have to install'
# the particular language for the program to run.
