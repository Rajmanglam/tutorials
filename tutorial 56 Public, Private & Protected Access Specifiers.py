# In high-level programming languages like C++, Java, etc., private, protected and public
# keywords are used to control the access of class members or variables. However, Python
# has no such keywords. Python uses a convention of prefixing the name of the variable or
# method with a single underscore(_) or double underscore(__) to emulate the behaviour of
# protected and private access specifiers.
